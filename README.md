# JuliaSimBatteries: high-performance lithium-ion battery simulations

## Simulate 1000 days of cycling in 60 seconds

Physical prototyping can take weeks, our product can prototype the same battery design in 60 seconds and help you build the best cells and packs. JuliaSimBatteries helps you reduce time and overhead to build better batteries 10x faster and at much lower cost.

## Introduction

JuliaSimBatteries is an advanced lithium-ion battery simulation tool integrating sophisticated electrochemical, thermal, and degradation physics. Utilizing the Doyle Fuller Newman (DFN) model, it can predict a battery's entire lifetime with fast charging 150,000 times faster than real time. The number of connected batteries is scalable from one cell to packs of thousands using electrochemical models. Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) enables the discovery of hidden governing laws from data, such as degradation and low-temperature behavior. Characterize material properties and propose battery designs using the parameter estimation and optimization tools in JuliaSim.
